struct_class = {

	class_or_substruct: {
	},

}

F afunction(){}
f = a function(){}

##
## Arrays handled as string objects anyway on the second level same with objects
## if needed use nested structs within arrays whole structs and whole struct pointers can be within the array depth
##

array_[0] = "main_array_depth::fetched_array_tree_pointer->new_array_depth*:::"

array_[0] = {

}

##
## Multidimensional arrays
## if struct contains arrays only do this, if struct contains mixed data sort the struct
## enables structs, arrays and objects to be intertwined into functional object packs
##

array_[1] = {
	
	sub_array = []
}

##
##
## Handling of Data 
## extract said string array or pointer array, carry with principles
## becoming memory based array tree pointers if wanted if not called the address will not exist
## Declaration by array call
##
array_[0]->[0]->[0]

##
## And thus the array is its own parted set of data instead of tree data
## which also allows for individual pointer set arrays and objects with even structs to be intermingeled manually
## without said pointer adddresses to the array object the addresses to the array depth doesn't exist
## to understand this? pointer trees are globals when the program is run, objects without addresses usually defaults when
## program is done with said code block pointer sets don't until the program loop ends
## pointers are means to ends
##
array_[0][0][0]

##
## if else in the byte interpeters it's usually coded like this this: or this ? if not then this
##

function_name: true ? ret 0

## if else code square brackets

function_name: true {
	variable = "string"
} ?{
	## some algorithm if not true
	ret 0; 
}

## C and C++ in one language without the damn mess
## Headers, define them in the same file and byte interpeter the header declarations if you must have it
## however you don't

hexdump -C example.crux | head -10

##
## inside strcuts or classes do this
##

struct_class = {
	constructor: {
		## this defines the struct into a struct function 
		## now just count the number of structs that has run in them
		## which then sorts itself into functional programmable tree that works in memory or not
		## yes this will create pointer sets
		run;

		## no memory runs
		## binaries use memory addresses as runtime pointers, hower you can still run functions without it
		## why pointers declaration happens in C
		run 0;

		## principles, if the program is running with the language then it's runtime
		## language so small it can embed while it's running which is already coded into the C, C++ binaries anyways
		## the binaries needs the functional struct and logic to even function
	}
}

##
## To explain you don't need to load the entire binary into memory part it up would match the functional programmable tree
## Also pointer tree
##
## isn't the C and c++ compilers even the opensourced ones adhering to propetariy way of writing compilers, their own binary file standards
## "yes our byte structure should be like this, it's more pretty" and then they cry about people being shallow
## 
## Mostly Operating System devs who write that stuff either way so, and cryptographers
##
## interpeter, it just identifies areas and logic, go old school and build it in ASCII hex binaries or just write the interpeter in C
## and fire out a binari of said interpeter which can compile code into new binaries or don't
## a binari that reads other binaries is called runtimes which also can create new and other binaries

## Do networking binaries ranges in hexidecimal, do sound binaries ranges in hexidecimal, do screen, the same with more hexidecimal variables
## some drivers requires DRM files which there is a standard for

## RFC manuals useful for protocol standards, filesystem standards, and some device standards
## basically computer science is in reality more simple then the overcomplicated mess of today's litterature written
## library? all of it is just 0x ranges, minifying that code is simpler then people think

## Fixed stars addresses
